#Football Manager Player Calculator

This program has a simple objective:

To allow the user - me - to easily calculate the desireability of a particular player.

To do this it will do several key things:

1. Import a csv, excel, or text file of player data
2. Import a csv, excel, or text file of position data
3. Import a csv, excel, or test file of general data
4. Score players at different positions by applying the position data to the player data
5. Score players overall by applying general data to the player data

Eventually, I would like to have the system tell me:
* the best position to play the players at
* the best formation to play the players in
* the best system/style attributes to play with
	* ie. short/direct/mixed passing
	* ie. easy/normal/hard tackling
	* ie. closing down vs. stand-off
